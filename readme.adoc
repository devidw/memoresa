= Memoresa Export

Memoresa has an export feature, but unfortunately - for me - the download dies after a few
seconds and never finishes.

To be able to still export, this is a deno script that downloads all attachments and
organizes them into directories with the name of the matter. Original file names
of the attachments are respected.

[source,plain]
----
out/
  some-matter/
    some-attachment.pdf
    another-attachment.jpg
  yet-another-matter/
    attachment.pdf

== Usage

=== Authentication

Copy the `token` cookie from the website into an environment variable:

[source,sh]
----
export MEMORESA_TOKEN=â€¦
----


=== Execute the script

[source,sh]
----
deno run --allow-all ./export.ts
----


== Caching

API responses are written in JSON files onto disk in a `./cache` directory.
Delete the directory to reset the cache.


== Empty files

For me, 2 of a few hundred downloads resulted in empty files, to identify them:

[source,sh]
----
find ./out -type f -empty -iname '*.pdf'
